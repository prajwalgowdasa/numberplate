What exactly are we trying to do?

License Plate Recognition Systems use the concept of optical character recognition to read the characters on a vehicle license plate. 
In other words, LPR takes the image of a vehicle as the input and outputs the characters written on its license plate.
Can you imagine how invaluable this would be to your undercover/detective skills? You can pull off all the necessary details about a car from the license plate characters.

LPR sometimes called ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) has 3 major stages.

1.License Plate Detection: This is the first and probably the most important stage of the system. It is at this stage that the position of the license plate is determined. The input at this stage is an image of the vehicle and the output is the license plate.
2.Character Segmentation: It’s at this stage the characters on the license plate are mapped out and segmented into individual images.
3.Character Recognition: This is where we wrap things up. The characters earlier segmented are identified here. We’ll be using machine learning for this.


Number Plate Processing
This project focuses on automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) using advanced image processing and segmentation techniques.
The system is designed to accurately detect and read vehicle number plates in real-time without the use of machine learning models.
FeaturesPlate Detection: Efficient algorithms for detecting number plates from vehicle images.
Character Segmentation: Isolating individual characters from the detected plate.Real-time 
Processing: Optimized for real-time applications with high accuracy.Cross-platform 
Compatibility: Works seamlessly across different operating systems.
